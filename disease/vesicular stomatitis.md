**Symptoms**

The symptoms of vesicular stomatitis typically appear within 2-5 days of infection and include:

* Vesicles (fluid-filled blisters) on the mouth, tongue, lips, muzzle, teats, and coronary bands of the hooves
* Painful eating and drinking
* Drooling
* Fever
* Swelling of the lymph nodes in the head and neck

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for vesicular stomatitis. Treatment is typically supportive and may include:

* Providing pain relief
* Administering fluids
* Treating secondary bacterial infections

**Causes**

Vesicular stomatitis is caused by a virus called vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), which is a member of the Rhabdoviridae family. VSV is spread through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions. It can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as feed, water, or equipment.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for vesicular stomatitis. However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Practicing good biosecurity measures
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus

**Differential diagnosis**

Vesicular stomatitis can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that cause mouth lesions, such as foot-and-mouth disease, contagious ecthyma, and bovine papular stomatitis. A veterinarian can diagnose vesicular stomatitis by testing a sample of the lesions for the presence of VSV.
