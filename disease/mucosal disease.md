## Mucosal disease

**Information:** Mucosal disease, also known as bovine ephemeral fever, is a viral disease that affects cattle. It is caused by a virus called bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV). Mucosal disease can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including fever, respiratory illness, diarrhea, and ulcers in the mouth and throat. In some cases, mucosal disease can also be fatal.

**Symptoms:**

* Fever
* Respiratory illness
* Diarrhea
* Ulcers in the mouth and throat
* Depression
* Weight loss

**Remedies:**

* There is no cure for mucosal disease.
* Treatment for mucosal disease is supportive care, such as fluids and antibiotics.
* Animals that have recovered from mucosal disease may be immune to future infection.

**Causes:**

* Mucosal disease is caused by a virus called bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV).
* This virus is found in the blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids of infected animals.
* Animals become infected with BEFV when they come into contact with the virus, such as through contact with the blood, saliva, or other bodily fluids of infected animals, or through contact with contaminated objects.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent mucosal disease is to vaccinate animals against the disease.
* Vaccinations are available for cattle.
* Other preventive measures include:
    * Maintaining good herd health practices
    * Practicing biosecurity measures
    * Testing animals for mucosal disease
    * Disposing of infected animals and their tissues properly
