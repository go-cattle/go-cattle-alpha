## Necrotic stomatitis (calf diphtheria)

**Information** : Necrotic stomatitis (calf diphtheria) is a bacterial infection of the mouth and throat of young calves caused by the bacterium Clostridium chauvoei. The bacteria produce a toxin that causes tissue death and necrosis.

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of necrotic stomatitis typically appear within 2-5 days of infection and include:

* Painful mouth and throat
* Drooling
* Fever
* Difficulty eating and drinking
* Swelling of the lymph nodes in the head and neck
* Necrotic lesions on the tongue, gums, and palate
* Death in severe cases

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for necrotic stomatitis. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Providing pain relief
* Administering fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections
* Administering antitoxin

**Causes**

Necrotic stomatitis (calf diphtheria) is caused by the bacterium Clostridium chauvoei. The bacteria are found in the environment, in soil, and in the feces of animals. Calves can become infected by ingesting the bacteria or by coming into contact with contaminated objects, such as feed, water, or equipment.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for necrotic stomatitis. However, there are a number of preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Practicing good biosecurity measures
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus

**Differential diagnosis**

Necrotic stomatitis can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that cause mouth lesions, such as foot-and-mouth disease, contagious ecthyma, and vesicular stomatitis. A veterinarian can diagnose necrotic stomatitis by testing a sample of the lesions for the presence of Clostridium chauvoei.
