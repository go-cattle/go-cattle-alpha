## Trichomoniasis

**Information:** Trichomoniasis is a venereal disease that affects cattle. It is caused by a protozoan parasite called Tritrichomonas foetus. Trichomoniasis can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including infertility, abortion, and early embryonic death.

**Symptoms:**

* Infertility
* Abortion
* Early embryonic death
* Vaginal discharge
* Inflammation of the uterus
* In some cases, no symptoms may be present

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for trichomoniasis.
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Antibiotics to treat secondary infections
    * Treatment of other reproductive problems
* Animals with trichomoniasis should be isolated from other animals to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Causes:**

* Trichomoniasis is caused by a protozoan parasite called Tritrichomonas foetus.
* This parasite is transmitted through sexual contact between bulls and cows.
* Once inside the animal's reproductive tract, the parasite can cause inflammation and infection.
* This can lead to infertility, abortion, and early embryonic death.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent trichomoniasis is to practice good breeding practices.
* This includes:
    * Separating bulls from cows that are not pregnant
    * Testing bulls for trichomoniasis before breeding
* Vaccinations are available for some types of trichomoniasis.

**Outlook:**

* The outlook for animals with trichomoniasis depends on the severity of the infection.
* Animals with mild infections may recover with treatment.
* Animals with severe infections may never be able to reproduce.
* Animals that recover from trichomoniasis may be immune to future infection.
