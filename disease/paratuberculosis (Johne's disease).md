## Paratuberculosis

### (Also Referred to as Johne's Disease)

**Information**

Paratuberculosis is a chronic, contagious bacterial disease of the intestinal tract that primarily affects sheep and cattle (most commonly dairy cattle), and goats as well as other ruminant species. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP).

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of paratuberculosis can vary depending on the stage of the disease. In the early stages, animals may show no symptoms or only mild symptoms, such as weight loss, decreased milk production, and intermittent diarrhea. In the later stages, animals may develop chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and wasting.

**Remedies**

There is no cure for paratuberculosis. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Providing fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections
* Administering antibiotics

**Causes**

Paratuberculosis is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP). MAP is a slow-growing bacterium that can survive for long periods of time in the environment. It is spread through the fecal-oral route, meaning that it can be transmitted through contact with infected animals' feces or contaminated feed or water.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for paratuberculosis. However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Testing cattle for MAP infection
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Practicing good hygiene and biosecurity measures
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus
