## Bovine besnoitiosis

**Information** : Bovine besnoitiosis is a parasitic disease of cattle caused by a protozoan parasite called Besnoitia besnoiti. The parasite is spread through the bite of infected biting flies, such as the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) and the horn fly (Haematobia irritans).

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of bovine besnoitiosis can vary depending on the severity of the infection and the animal's individual immune response. Some infected cattle may show no symptoms at all, while others may develop a range of symptoms, including:

* Fever
* Depression
* Weight loss
* Anemia
* Enlarged lymph nodes
* Lameness
* Skin lesions
* Abortion
* Death

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for bovine besnoitiosis. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Administering fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections

**Causes**

Bovine besnoitiosis is caused by a protozoan parasite called Besnoitia besnoiti. The parasite is spread through the bite of infected biting flies, such as the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) and the horn fly (Haematobia irritans).

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for bovine besnoitiosis. However, there are some preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Controlling biting flies
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus
* Testing cattle for bovine besnoitiosis
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
