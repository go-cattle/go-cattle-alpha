## Coccidiosis

**Information:** Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease that affects cattle, sheep, goats, and other animals. It is caused by protozoan parasites called coccidia. Coccidiosis can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including diarrhea, weight loss, and death.

**Symptoms:**

* Diarrhea
* Weight loss
* Depression
* Dehydration
* Pale mucous membranes
* Fever
* Death

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for coccidiosis.
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration
    * Antibiotics to treat secondary infections
    * Antiparasitic drugs to kill the coccidia
* Animals with coccidiosis should be isolated from other animals to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Causes:**

* Coccidiosis is caused by protozoan parasites called coccidia.
* These parasites are found in the feces of infected animals.
* Animals become infected with coccidia when they ingest the feces of an infected animal.
* Once inside the animal's body, the coccidia can infect the lining of the intestines and cause inflammation.
* This can lead to diarrhea, weight loss, and death.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent coccidiosis is to control parasites in the environment.
* This can be done by:
    * Practicing good sanitation
    * Rotating grazing pastures
* Animals should be vaccinated against coccidiosis.
* Other preventive measures include:
    * Maintaining good herd health practices
    * Practicing biosecurity measures
    * Testing animals for coccidiosis
    * Disposing of infected animals and their tissues properly
