## Vibriosis (campylobacteriosis)

**Information:** Vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) is a bacterial disease that affects cattle. It is caused by bacteria called Campylobacter fetus. Vibriosis can cause a variety of symptoms in affected animals, including abortion, infertility, and poor conception rates.

**Symptoms:**

* Abortion
* Infertility
* Poor conception rates
* Vaginal discharge
* Inflammation of the uterus
* In some cases, no symptoms may be present

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for vibriosis (campylobacteriosis).
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Antibiotics to treat secondary infections
    * Treatment of other reproductive problems
* Animals with vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) should be isolated from other animals to prevent the spread of the disease.

**Causes:**

* Vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) is caused by bacteria called Campylobacter fetus.
* These bacteria are found in the reproductive tract of infected animals.
* Animals become infected with Campylobacter fetus when they come into contact with the bacteria, such as through sexual contact between bulls and cows.
* Once inside the animal's reproductive tract, the bacteria can cause inflammation and infection.
* This can lead to abortion, infertility, and poor conception rates.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) is to practice good breeding practices.
* This includes:
    * Separating bulls from cows that are not pregnant
    * Testing bulls for vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) before breeding
* Vaccinations are available for some types of vibriosis (campylobacteriosis).

**Outlook:**

* The outlook for animals with vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) depends on the severity of the infection.
* Animals with mild infections may recover with treatment.
* Animals with severe infections may never be able to reproduce.
* Animals that recover from vibriosis (campylobacteriosis) may be immune to future infection.
