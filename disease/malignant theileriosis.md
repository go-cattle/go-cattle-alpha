## Malignant theileriosis

**Information** : Malignant theileriosis is a tick-borne disease of cattle caused by the protozoan parasite Theileria annulata. The parasite is spread through the bite of infected ticks. Malignant theileriosis is a serious disease that can be fatal if not treated.

**Symptoms**

The symptoms of malignant theileriosis typically appear within 1-2 weeks of infection and include:

* Fever
* Depression
* Weight loss
* Pale mucous membranes
* Jaundice
* Increased heart rate and respiratory rate
* Hemoglobinuria (blood in the urine)
* Death

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for malignant theileriosis. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Administering fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections
* Administering anti-parasitic drugs

**Causes**

Malignant theileriosis is caused by the protozoan parasite Theileria annulata. The parasite is spread through the bite of infected ticks. The most common tick vectors for malignant theileriosis in cattle are Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp. and Ixodes spp.

**Prevention**

There are a number of preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of malignant theileriosis in cattle, such as:

* Using tick control measures, such as acaricides and tick dips
* Vaccinating cattle against malignant theileriosis
* Testing cattle for malignant theileriosis
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Treating contaminated feed and water

**Differential diagnosis**

Malignant theileriosis can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that cause fever, weight loss, and anemia, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and leptospirosis. A veterinarian can diagnose malignant theileriosis by testing a sample of the blood for the presence of Theileria annulata.
