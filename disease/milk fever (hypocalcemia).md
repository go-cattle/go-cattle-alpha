## Milk fever (hypocalcemia)

**Information:** Milk fever, also known as hypocalcemia, is a metabolic disorder that affects dairy cows shortly after calving. It is caused by a sudden drop in blood calcium levels.

**Symptoms:**

* Weakness
* Trembling
* Difficulty standing
* Depression
* Muscle twitching
* Convulsions
* Coma

**Remedies:**

* Milk fever is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
* Treatment usually involves giving the cow an injection of calcium.
* The cow may also need fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.
* In severe cases, the cow may need to be hospitalized.

**Causes:**

* Milk fever is caused by a sudden drop in blood calcium levels.
* This can happen because the cow's body uses up a lot of calcium to produce milk.
* It can also happen if the cow does not get enough calcium in her diet.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent milk fever is to make sure that the cow has a diet that is high in calcium.
* The cow should also be getting enough magnesium and phosphorus.
* It is also important to monitor the cow's calcium levels during the first few days after calving.
* If the cow's calcium levels are low, she may need to be given an injection of calcium.

**Outlook:**

* With prompt treatment, most cows with milk fever make a full recovery.
* However, if treatment is delayed, the cow may die.
* Animals that recover from milk fever may be more likely to get it again in the future.
