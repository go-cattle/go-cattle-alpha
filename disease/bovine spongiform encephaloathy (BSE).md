## Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)

**Information:** Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, is a fatal neurological disease that affects cattle. BSE is caused by a prion, which is a misfolded protein that can cause other proteins to fold abnormally. This can lead to the destruction of brain tissue and the development of spongiform lesions in the brain.

**Symptoms:**

* In early stages: Behavioral changes, such as nervousness or aggression, decreased milk production, weight loss
* In later stages: Difficulty walking, staggering, incoordination, muscle tremors, difficulty chewing and swallowing, salivation, excessive urination and defecation, coma

**Remedies:**

* There is no cure for BSE.
* Animals that are diagnosed with BSE are typically euthanized.

**Causes:**

* BSE is caused by a prion, which is a misfolded protein that can cause other proteins to fold abnormally.
* The prion that causes BSE can be transmitted through contact with infected animals, their bodily fluids, or contaminated feed.
* BSE can also be transmitted from mother to calf during pregnancy or at birth.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent BSE is to control the spread of prions.
* This can be done by:
    * Implementing strict biosecurity measures, such as preventing contact between infected and uninfected animals
    * Disposing of infected animals and their tissues properly
    * Vaccinating animals against BSE

**Vaccination:**

* There is a vaccine available for BSE, but it is not widely used.
* The vaccine is not 100% effective, and it is not clear how long protection from the vaccine lasts.

**Other preventive measures:**

* Avoid feeding cattle feed that may be contaminated with BSE prions, such as meat and bone meal
* Monitor animals for signs of illness
* Dispose of dead animals properly
* Vaccinate animals according to the manufacturer's instructions
