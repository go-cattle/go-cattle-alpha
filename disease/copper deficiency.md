## Copper deficiency

**Information:** Copper is an essential trace mineral for cattle. It is involved in many important functions in the body, including:

* Red blood cell production
* Bone development
* Immune function
* Nervous system function
* Metabolism

**Symptoms:**

* Poor growth
* Anemia
* Bone deformities
* Depigmentation of the hair and skin
* Neurological problems, such as ataxia (incoordination) and seizures
* Reproductive problems, such as abortion and stillbirth
* Death

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for copper deficiency.
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Feeding copper-rich supplements
    * Treating other underlying conditions

**Causes:**

* Copper deficiency is caused by a lack of copper in the diet.
* Copper is found in soil, and areas with low copper levels in the soil are more likely to have cattle with copper deficiency.
* Cattle can also become deficient in copper if they are fed grain that has been grown in low-copper soil.
* Copper deficiency is more common in young animals, pregnant animals, and animals that are stressed.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent copper deficiency is to feed cattle a diet that is copper-rich.
* Copper supplements are also available.
* Cattle that are at risk of copper deficiency, such as those that are grazing in low-copper areas, should be supplemented with copper.
