## Grass tetany (hypomagnesemia)

**Information:** Grass tetany, also known as **summer pasture disease** or **grass staggers**, is a metabolic disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by a low level of magnesium in the blood.

**Symptoms:**

* Muscle tremors
* Stiffness
* Difficulty walking
* Convulsions
* Coma

**Remedies:**

* There is no specific cure for grass tetany.
* Treatment is usually supportive and may include:
    * Administering magnesium sulfate intravenously
    * Treating other underlying conditions

**Causes:**

* Grass tetany is caused by a low level of magnesium in the blood.
* Magnesium is important for muscle function, and a low level of magnesium can lead to muscle tremors and seizures.
* Grass tetany is more common in spring and early summer, when cattle are grazing on new growth grass.
* New growth grass is often low in magnesium.
* Grass tetany is also more common in pregnant cattle and in cattle that are stressed.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent grass tetany is to feed cattle a diet that is high in magnesium.
* Magnesium supplements are also available.
* Cattle that are at risk of grass tetany, such as those that are grazing on new growth grass, should be supplemented with magnesium.
