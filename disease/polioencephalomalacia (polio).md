## Polioencephalomalacia (polio)

**Information:** Polioencephalomalacia, also known as cerebrocortical necrosis, is a neurological disorder that affects cattle. It is caused by a deficiency of thiamine, a B vitamin.

**Symptoms:**

* Head pressing
* Blindness
* Incoordination
* Seizures
* Coma

**Remedies:**

* Polioencephalomalacia is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.
* Treatment usually involves giving the cow an injection of thiamine.
* The cow may also need to be given fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration.
* In severe cases, the cow may need to be hospitalized.

**Causes:**

* Polioencephalomalacia is caused by a deficiency of thiamine, a B vitamin. Thiamine is essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system.
* Cattle are more likely to develop polioencephalomalacia if they are fed a diet that is low in thiamine.
* Polioencephalomalacia can also occur if cattle are stressed or if they have a liver disease.

**Prevention:**

* The best way to prevent polioencephalomalacia is to feed cattle a diet that is high in thiamine.
* Cattle should also be provided with plenty of fresh water.
* Stress should be minimized.
* Cattle with liver disease should be monitored closely.
* Animals should be monitored for signs of polioencephalomalacia, such as head pressing, blindness, and incoordination.
* If an animal is suspected of having polioencephalomalacia, it should be taken to a veterinarian immediately for diagnosis and treatment.
