**Causes:**

* Papillomatosis is caused by a virus called bovine papillomavirus (BPV).
* This virus is found in the skin, teats, and mouth of infected animals.
* Animals become infected with BPV when they come into contact with the virus, such as through contact with the skin, teats, or mouth of infected animals, or through contact with contaminated objects.
