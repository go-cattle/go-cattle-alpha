**Symptoms**

The symptoms of contagious ecthyma typically appear within 2-5 days of infection and include:

* Raised, crusty lesions on the lips, tongue, muzzle, teats, and coronary bands of the hooves
* Painful eating and drinking
* Drooling
* Fever
* Swelling of the lymph nodes in the head and neck

**Remedies**

There is no specific treatment for contagious ecthyma. Treatment is usually supportive and may include:

* Providing pain relief
* Administering fluids and electrolytes
* Treating secondary bacterial infections

**Causes**

Contagious ecthyma (orf) is caused by the orf virus, which is a member of the poxvirus family. The virus is spread through direct contact with infected animals or their secretions. The virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated objects, such as feed, water, or equipment.

**Prevention**

There is no vaccine available for contagious ecthyma. However, there are a number of preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection, such as:

* Practicing good biosecurity measures
* Isolating infected animals from healthy animals
* Cleaning and disinfecting contaminated areas
* Vaccinating cattle against other diseases that can weaken the immune system, such as bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and rotavirus

**Differential diagnosis**

Contagious ecthyma can be difficult to distinguish from other diseases that cause mouth lesions, such as foot-and-mouth disease, bovine papular stomatitis, and vesicular stomatitis. A veterinarian can diagnose contagious ecthyma by testing a sample of the lesions for the presence of the orf virus.
